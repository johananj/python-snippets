def my_function:
```
- Variables. Same as functions
```
x = 2
my_variable = 'two'
cur_value = 5
```
- Constants. Values that don't change. Caps. 
```
CONSTANT_VALUE = 27
```
- Classes. Camel case.

class Cat():
```
- Methods. Same as functions
- Modules. Lowercase. Words separated by underscore. 
```

- Variable names. 
    + Use meaningful names. 
    + Instead of x,y,z.
- Function names. 
    + Shortening is not helpful. Readability. 
    + db vs double_this vs multiply_by_two

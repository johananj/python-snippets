# Python Snippets
This repository contains some python snippets for my future reference.
It is also meant to act as a personal python refresher. 

# Credits
Give credit where credit is due. Some sources where I get my information.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) is really good for quick references.
- [Real Python](https://realpython.com) has some amazing articles that explore python concepts deeply. Its good if you want to sit and learn something worth while.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for anything specific on the fly.
- [Delft Stack](https://www.delftstack.com/tags/python/) maybe, for something between W3 Schools and Real Python.
